MapMap
====== 
MapMap is a free video mapping software.

Projection mapping, also known as video mapping and spatial augmented
reality, is a projection technology used to turn objects, often
irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection.
These objects may be complex industrial landscapes, such as buildings.
By using specialized software, a two or three dimensional object is
spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the real
environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a
projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object.
This technique is used by artists and advertisers alike who can add
extra dimensions, optical illusions, and notions of movement onto
previously static objects. The video is commonly combined with, or
triggered by, audio to create an audio-visual narrative.
