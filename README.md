> **Modern, High-Performance Projection Mapping Suite**

MapMap is a professional-grade, open-source projection mapping system being completely rewritten in Rust. Originally a C++/Qt application, MapMap is being transformed into a modern, high-performance tool capable of competing with commercial solutions like Resolume Arena.

## 🎯 Vision

Projection mapping (also known as video mapping and spatial augmented reality) is a projection technology used to turn objects—often irregularly shaped—into display surfaces for video projection. MapMap aims to provide a professional, open-source alternative for artists, designers, and technical professionals who need powerful projection mapping capabilities without the cost of commercial software.

## 🚀 Project Status
