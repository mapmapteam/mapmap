MapMap
====== 
MapMap is a free video mapping software.

Projection mapping, also known as video mapping and spatial augmented reality,
is a projection technology used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into
a display surface for video projection. These objects may be complex industrial
landscapes, such as buildings. By using specialized software, a two or three
dimensional object is spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the
real environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a
projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object. This
technique is used by artists and advertisers alike who can add extra dimensions,
optical illusions, and notions of movement onto previously static objects. The
video is commonly combined with, or triggered by, audio to create an
audio-visual narrative.
