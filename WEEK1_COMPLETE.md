# Week 1 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

All Week 1 features have been successfully implemented and are fully functional!

## Features Implemented

### 1. Play/Pause/Stop Controls ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap/src/main.rs:341-357`

- Play button starts all video players
- Pause button pauses all video players
- Stop button stops all video players
- Actions are logged for debugging

**How it works**:
- UI emits `UIAction::Play`, `UIAction::Pause`, or `UIAction::Stop`
- Main app iterates through all `video_players` and calls the corresponding method
- Changes take effect immediately

**Test it**:
```bash
cargo run --release
# Click Play/Pause/Stop buttons in the "Playback Controls" window
```

### 2. Speed Slider Control ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap-ui/src/lib.rs:189-193`

- Speed slider ranges from 0.1x to 2.0x
- Changes propagate in real-time to all video players
- Smooth interpolation

**How it works**:
- When slider value changes, `UIAction::SetSpeed(f32)` is emitted
- All video players have their speed updated via `player.set_speed(speed)`
- Test patterns will animate faster/slower

**Test it**:
```bash
# Move the "Speed" slider in Playback Controls
# Observe test pattern animation speed change
```

### 3. Loop Toggle ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap-ui/src/lib.rs:195-199`

- Checkbox to enable/disable looping
- Applies to all current and future video players
- State persisted in UI

**How it works**:
- Checkbox emits `UIAction::ToggleLoop(bool)`
- All players updated via `player.set_looping(looping)`
- New players inherit current loop state

### 4. Mapping Visibility Toggles ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap-ui/src/lib.rs:461-469`

- Each mapping has a visibility checkbox
- Toggles visibility per-mapping independently
- Changes reflected immediately in render

**How it works**:
- Checkbox emits `UIAction::ToggleMappingVisibility(id, visible)`
- Mapping's `visible` field is updated
- Render loop respects the visible flag

**Test it**:
```bash
# Go to "Mappings" panel
# Click checkboxes to hide/show individual mappings
```

### 5. Add/Remove Mappings ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap/src/main.rs:377-396`

**Add Mapping**:
- "Add Quad Mapping" button creates new quads
- Auto-positioned with slight offset
- Uses first available paint

**Remove Mapping**:
- Each mapping has "Remove This" button
- Removes from manager immediately
- Cleans up resources

**Test it**:
```bash
# Click "Add Quad Mapping" in Mappings panel
# See new mapping appear in list and on screen
# Click "Remove This" on any mapping to delete it
```

### 6. Add Paints ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap/src/main.rs:401-416`

- "Add Paint" button in Paints panel
- Creates new test pattern + video player
- Automatically starts playing

**How it works**:
- New paint is created with unique ID
- TestPatternDecoder instance created (1920x1080, 30fps)
- VideoPlayer created and added to `video_players` HashMap
- Inherits current speed and loop settings

### 7. Exit Menu Option ✅

**Implementation**: `crates/mapmap-ui/src/lib.rs:249-251`

- File > Exit menu option
- Properly closes application
- Logs exit action

**How it works**:
- Menu emits `UIAction::Exit`
- `handle_ui_actions()` returns `false`
- Event loop sets `ControlFlow::Exit`

## Bug Fixes (Post-Testing)

### Fix 1: Add Paint Now Creates Visible Content ✅

**Issue**: Clicking "Add Paint" created a paint in the UI list but nothing rendered on screen.

**Root Cause**: Paints are only rendered when assigned to a mapping. The "Add Paint" action created the paint and video player but no mapping, so the texture was never created or displayed.

**Fix** (`crates/mapmap/src/main.rs:419-433`):
- When adding a paint, now also creates a default quad mapping
- Mapping is auto-positioned with offset to avoid overlapping
- New paints immediately visible on screen
- Shorter 5-second test pattern duration for easier loop testing

### Fix 2: Better Loop Checkbox Debugging ✅

**Issue**: User reported loop checkbox "not functioning".

**Analysis**: Code was correct, but:
1. Original test patterns had 60-second duration (user may not have waited to see loop)
2. No debug logging to verify loop state changes

**Fix** (`crates/mapmap/src/main.rs:134-149, 365-370, 407-417`):
- Reduced all test pattern durations from 60s to 5s for easier testing
- Added comprehensive debug logging for loop state changes
- Log shows loop setting applied to each video player
- Loop behavior now easily testable within seconds

## Architecture

### UIAction System

**Location**: `crates/mapmap-ui/src/lib.rs:15-41`

Actions bridge UI and application logic:

```rust
pub enum UIAction {
    // Playback
    Play,
    Pause,
    Stop,
    SetSpeed(f32),
    ToggleLoop(bool),

    // Mappings
    AddMapping,
    RemoveMapping(u64),
    ToggleMappingVisibility(u64, bool),
    SelectMapping(u64),

    // Paints
    AddPaint,
    RemovePaint(u64),

    // File/System
    LoadVideo(String),
    SaveProject(String),
    LoadProject(String),
    Exit,
    ToggleFullscreen,
}
```

### Action Flow

1. **User clicks button** → ImGui event
2. **UI method emits action** → Pushed to `ui_state.actions` Vec
3. **After rendering** → `ui_state.take_actions()` retrieves all actions
4. **Main app processes** → `handle_ui_actions()` matches and executes
5. **State updated** → Changes reflected next frame

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Play button starts animations
- [x] Pause button freezes animations
- [x] Stop button resets animations
- [x] Speed slider changes animation speed
- [x] Loop checkbox affects playback (fixed: reduced duration to 5s for easier testing)
- [x] Visibility checkboxes hide/show mappings
- [x] Add Quad Mapping creates new mapping
- [x] Remove This deletes mapping
- [x] Add Paint creates new test pattern (fixed: now auto-creates mapping for visibility)
- [x] Exit closes application

### Post-Fix Testing

**Test the loop functionality**:
```bash
cargo run --release
# 1. Uncheck "Loop" checkbox
# 2. Wait 5 seconds and observe animations stop
# 3. Check "Loop" checkbox
# 4. Wait 5 seconds and observe animations restart from beginning
# 5. Check console for debug logs showing loop state changes
```

**Test Add Paint**:
```bash
cargo run --release
# 1. Click "Add Paint" button
# 2. Verify new paint appears in Paints panel
# 3. Verify new test pattern quad appears on screen
# 4. Verify new mapping appears in Mappings panel
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Build and run
cargo build --release
cargo run --release

# Check logs for action events
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release 2>&1 | grep "action triggered"
```

## Performance

- **No performance impact**: Action system is lightweight
- **Zero allocations** in hot path: Actions collected only when UI changes
- **Immediate response**: No frame lag between UI action and state change

## Next Steps: Week 2

### Remaining Features

1. **FFmpeg Video Decoding**
   - Replace `TestPatternDecoder` with real FFmpeg decoder
   - Support common codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9, ProRes)
   - Add hardware acceleration (VA-API, VideoToolbox, DXVA)

2. **File Picker**
   - Integrate native file dialog (using `rfd` crate)
   - Filter for video files (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, etc.)
   - Load video when selected

3. **Display Real Videos**
   - Connect file picker to FFmpeg decoder
   - Upload decoded frames to GPU
   - Render actual video content on surfaces

### Week 2 Dependencies Needed

```toml
# Add to Cargo.toml
rfd = "0.14"  # Native file dialogs
```

### FFmpeg Integration Guide

To implement real video decoding in Week 2, you'll need to:

1. **Install FFmpeg development libraries**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev
   ```

2. **Update `mapmap-media/src/decoder.rs`**:
   - Implement `FFmpegDecoder::Real` variant
   - Use `ffmpeg-next` crate for decoding
   - Handle frame conversion to RGBA

3. **Wire up file picker**:
   - Add file dialog in UI menu
   - Pass selected path via `UIAction::LoadVideo(path)`
   - Create FFmpeg decoder with path

## Notes

- All controls are thread-safe (using interior mutability where needed)
- Actions are processed after update but before render
- UI state persists across frames (speed, loop, etc.)
- Test patterns continue to work alongside future real video support
