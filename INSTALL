Build instructions
==================
This file is written in rst, so that one can use rst2pdf to create a PDF out of it.


Build on GNU/Linux
------------------

Install the dependencies. (see below)

Build it::

  ./build.sh

Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04 LTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install basic development tools fot Qt projects, plus liblo for OSC support::

  sudo apt-get install -y \
      liblo-dev \
      qttools5-dev-tools \
      qt5-default


Install GStreamer 1.0 libraries and plugins:

  sudo apt-get install -y \
      libgstreamer1.0-dev \
      libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
      gstreamer1.0-gnonlin \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
      gstreamer1.0-libav \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-apps \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
      gstreamer1.0-x \
      gstreamer1.0-tools

Install extra packages if you want to build the documentation::

  sudo apt-get install -y \
      doxygen \
      graphviz \
      rst2pdf

To edit translations
--------------------
You might need to update the files::
  
  lupdate mapmap.pro 

Then, do this::
  
  lrelease mapmap.pro

Build on Mac OS X
-----------------

NOTE: This has been tested on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).

Install tools and dependencies:

1) Install the Apple Developer Tools
  - You need to register with a credit card in the Apple Store in order to download it (no need to pay, but Apple needs your soul).
2) Install Qt5
  - You can get the open source version from http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
  - Run the installer and choose the default location (which should be ~/Qt).
  - Latest tested version: 5.5.1
3) Install liblo
  - Use the following guide: http://macappstore.org/liblo/
  - OR compile from the tar.gz - it should install it to /usr/local
4) Install the GStreamer framework. You need the runtime and devel packages to be installed:
  - https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.6.0/gstreamer-1.0-1.6.0-x86_64.pkg
  - https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.6.0/gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.6.0-x86_64.pkg
  - http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.6.0/gstreamer-1.0-1.6.0-x86_64-packages.dmg

Do this::

  ./build.sh

It will create a .app and a .dmg.

DMGVERSION.txt should be created automatically with "1" as its contents. Update to "2", and so on, if needed.


Use on OS X
-----------
Users can simply the following two packages:

http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.6.0/gstreamer-1.0-1.6.0-x86_64-packages.dmg
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.6.0/gstreamer-1.0-1.6.0-x86_64.pkg

MapMap should then work.

If the appearance of the window of the OSC port number in the preferences seem corrupted, you might want to reset MapMap's preferences::

  rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/info.mapmap.MapMap.plist
